      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What happened to L&A Designs?</h3>
      <p>
        We are unsure of the status of L&A Designs, but they are no longer in
        operation. We are still here to serve you with the same high-quality
        products.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the difference between L&L Extreme products and others?</h3>
      <p>
        The L&L Extreme clutch is made from superior materials and is 100% built
        in the USA. It comes with a lifetime warranty, and you can reach us
        seven days a week for support.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I know if I need to replace the 52-tooth gear?</h3>
      <p>
        Your Raptor's 52-tooth gear may be damaged by the stock one-way bearing.
        If it shows signs of wear (scarring, galling, or out-of-tolerance), it's
        advisable to replace it. If the clutch failed on the gear, both the
        clutch and gear should be replaced to avoid potential warranty issues.
      </p>

      <h3>What's the difference between the 2001-2003 and 2004-2005 models?</h3>
      <p>
        The 2001-2003 Raptor one-way is more prone to failure. The main
        difference is the inner diameter of the hub: the 01-03 units have a
        2-inch diameter, while the 04-05 units have a 2.25-inch diameter. Check
        your VIN number for the year.
      </p>

      <h3>How can you offer a lifetime warranty?</h3>
      <p>
        We offer a lifetime warranty because we are confident in the durability
        of our products. Our goal is to provide a trouble-free riding
        experience. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at
        503-484-8711.
